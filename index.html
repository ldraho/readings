  <h1>Reflections on the Weekly Readings</h1>

  <h2>Sept 29</h2>
  <h3>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin, 1935.<h3/>
</p>This reading is a lot to make sense of.<p/>
  <h2>Oct 6</h2>
  <h3>As We May Think, by Vannevar Bush, published in The Atlantic Monthly, 1945.<h3/>
    
  </p>It was fascinating to read what would be the origins around the concept of the world wide web, or what was sometimes called in the early years (e.g. the 90s)  the 'information super highway. What struck me most was how his intentions seemed so noble and logical. Why not 'link' all relatable or relevant information together for the sake of learning, inventions, and retention of valuable information. But here we are, 80 years later, and the information system of the internet is in many ways working against us. It is full of misinformation, explotative content, and useless AI slop.<p/> 
    
  </p>As we are moving into the next phase of digital technology with AI, the 'links' to pages where we sort through information are now summarized through AI. Not only do we not have to remember anything, we also don't have to process the information. While the internet and the digital age have yielded positives, I wonder if Vannevar gave thought to the negative potential of the memex machine. As we ponder the impact of AI, so much attention has been paid to its anticipated downsides. It seems we may have learned our lesson - whatever is helpful can also be harmful.<p/>
