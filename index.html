  <h2>Sept 29</h2>
  <h3>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin, 1935.<h3/>
   
</p>This reading is a lot to make sense of.<p/>

  <h2>Oct 6</h2>
  <h2>As We May Think, by Vannevar Bush, published in The Atlantic Monthly, 1945.<h2/>
    
  </p>It was fascinating to read what would be the origins around the concept of the world wide web, or what was sometimes called in the early years (e.g. the 90s)  the 'information super highway. What struck me most was how his intentions seemed so noble and logical. Why not 'link' all relatable or relevant information together for the sake of learning, inventions, and retention of valuable information. But here we are, 80 years later, and the information system of the internet is in many ways working against us. It is full of misinformation, explotative content, and useless AI slop.<p/> 
    
  </p>As we are moving into the next phase of digital technology with AI, the 'links' to pages where we sort through information are now summarized through AI. Not only do we not have to remember anything, we also don't have to process the information. While the internet and the digital age have yielded positives, I wonder if Vannevar gave thought to the negative potential of the memex machine. As we ponder the impact of AI, so much attention has been paid to its anticipated downsides. It seems we may have learned our lesson - whatever is helpful can also be harmful.<p/>

    <h2>Oct 14</h2>
  <h2>Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1970.<h2/>
    
</p>If only Debord could see society in the digital age. "The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people mediated by images.” This argument takes on new meaning in the digital age where we are the consumers and makers of media. During the time when he would have written Society of the Spectacle, the consumer was influenced by the images that were created and shared largely by commerce - advertising, television, movies, and magazines. That a way of relating to each other, not through lived experience, but mediated through the image. But now there is shift in power and access. If we consider the social media platforms to be openely accessible, then we are now creating our own images of reality. The concept is the same - that we relate to each other via images - but the fact that we are makers in advancing these perceptions is different from Debord's era. The 'people' create new realties, norms, expectations, standards of beauty, entertainment, cultural trends, etc. 
    His idea that the real consumer becomes a consumer of illusions,” buying not use-value but the symbolic promise of satisfaction, seems not only relevant today, but the experience itself - not just the commodity - is a sybmol. When travel influencers create their images, they are showcasing a curated and coveted lifestyle to create desire in the observer.  
     It is perhaps not surprising that American has become even more the society of spectacle. By having access to an audience via the digital platforms, our identities and realities are blurred. We no longer know what is real. We have moved from relating to the objects and drawing meaning and identity, to now creating worlds that are shared online. It is society of the spectacle on steroids. Are we victims of mass consumerism, or a capitalist world order. Yes, but at least some of us are now the economic makers, not just the recepients of the experience.<p/>
